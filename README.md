A Simple ox_inventory Vehicle Mileage / Auto Parts System

## [PUBLIC WIP]
Expect Issues / Bugs / Fixes

### Features
- Oil System: Tracks oil life for each vehicle and updates accordingly.
- Mileage Tracking: Records mileage for each vehicle based on its license plate.
- Auto Parts Integration: Includes ox_inventory items for purchasing various auto parts such as oil, wrenches, sockets, suspension parts, engine mods, turbo kits, and more.
### Installation
- Database Setup: Ensure you have a MySQL database configured and update it with the required tables for storing vehicle mileage and oil life.
- ox_inventory Items: Add the necessary items to your ox_inventory configuration to enable the purchase of auto parts like oil, wrenches, sockets, suspension parts, engine mods, turbo kits, etc.
### Usage
- Oil System: The oil life for each vehicle decreases over time and with usage. Players can purchase oil and other auto parts to maintain their vehicles.
- Mileage Tracking: The mileage for each vehicle is tracked based on its license plate and updated in real-time as the vehicle is driven. The system saves the mileage to the database when the player exits the vehicle.
  ## Note
## This system is a work in progress. Expect issues, bugs, and fixes as development continues.
